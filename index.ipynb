    "### **Project Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "The short-term rental market in Nairobi has witnessed significant growth driven by digital platforms like Airbnb. As competition intensifies, both new and experienced hosts, investors, and property managers are looking for data-driven insights to inform pricing, property configuration, and guest engagement strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project leverages publicly available Airbnb datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and performance benchmarks for listings within Nairobi. The primary focus is to **understand what drives revenue, occupancy, and guest satisfaction**, and to identify how different listing characteristics impact these outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Business Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Optimize Listing Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify key features (room type, number of beds, superhost status, photo count, etc.) that correlate with high revenue, occupancy, and reviews.\n",
    "* Provide actionable recommendations to hosts on how to configure or enhance their listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Understand Guest Behavior**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analyze review patterns to understand when and how guests engage with listings.\n",
    "* Use review frequency and timing to infer guest satisfaction and listing popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Benchmark Competitors**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Help hosts compare their performance (e.g., occupancy, revenue, reviews) to market averages and top-performing listings.\n",
    "* Reveal what differentiates top-tier listings from underperformers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Support Strategic Pricing and Investment**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inform pricing strategy by linking listing features to revenue and occupancy.\n",
